#swap

This is a hostoric project from 2000, which played with semntic web and linked data ideas. 
The emphasis was very much on the Web in Semanti Web. There is a lot of cool stuff in here, 
including *cwm*, a rule engine for N3 rules, with lots of built-in functions including crypto.
So you can build quite interesting applications just using rules.  

Also a bunch of programs for coinverting things into and out of RDF.

See the home pages of:

- [The SWAP project](https://github.com/linkeddata/swap/blob/master/Overview.html)
- [The CWM program](http://linkeddata.github.io/swap/doc/cwm.html)

Those pages are not maintained.

2018: The version history of the original CVS code management project has been preserved in this Github hosted git repository.
This is a target GIT repo for import of the CVS repo behind http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap, an early semantic web platform.
